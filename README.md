Simple application for viewing you match history in Artifact.

# Note

On the [Game History page](https://steamcommunity.com/my/gcpd/583950/?category=Games&amp;tab=MatchPlayers), there are muliple values for the same game, with the only changing value being the deck code. 
Also, the deck code isn't correct and it seems it's Valve's problem. [Info](https://twitter.com/JoshLmao/status/1072991524542132231)
